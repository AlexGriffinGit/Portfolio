				Hi I'm Alex, and as you might have learnt I've just graduated from Staffordshire University with a Computer Games Programming degree.
				Now I'm looking for the next step of my career.
				<br>
				<br>
				I enjoy programming and writing code and love seeing my vision for projects start to take shape (in fact that's what I loved about making this portfolio), even if most 
				of my projects are still plagued by programmer art, see project pages for examples.
				<br>
				Most of my time at university was geared towards the game side of programming. I thoroughly enjoy developing interesting ideas and mechanics for all types of games and
				I believe I can bring those interesting ideas and passion to a business environment.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm most comfortable using C++ and C# and like the experience that Unity provides but I'm open to all opportunities and would use any
				chance to expand my existing skillset.  
				<br>
				I'm currently learning Javascript and Python and am enjoying how versatile and flexible they are.
				<br>
				<br>
