<p>
We All Die Poor is a 2D wave survival game that was developed during the 2018 Ukie Student Games Jam at Staffordshire University by me and 4 of my friends, we developed We All Die Poor in the Unity Game Engine.
Those friends were Peter Bush, Ricky Williams, Ben Melling and Oakley Blakemore. The Ukie Student Games Jam took place over 30 hours. The theme for the game jam was <b>change</b>, we decided to take this literally and 
we built off of the idea of using exact monetary change as a projectile to defeat enemies. We All Die Poor was the winner chosen from the games made at Staffordshire university.
<br>
<br>
We decided to go for a apocalypse setting and therefore zombies were a solid enemy choice, 
in a zombie apocalypse there's probably a lot of change going unused. 
To dispatch these zombies the player has 7 different coins at their disposal: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and a pound coin. These coins just so happen to be the 
zombies weakness. Each zombie has a specific value applied to it and the player must reach this value using the different coins. Going over the displayed amount won't work 
as the zombies require exact change to perish; for example if a zombie requirng 37p appears the player can fire a 20p to take it down to 17p, but shooting another 20p will have no effect.
Instead the player would have to shoot a 10p, a 5p and a 2p to defeat it. The player has three lives displayed in the top left of the screen, each time a zombie reaches the player 
they lose a life, after their lives have been depleted the game is over and the player is overrun.
