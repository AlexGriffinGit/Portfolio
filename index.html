   <h2>We All Die Poor</h2>
   <p id="indexBoxText">
    We All Die Poor is a 2D wave survival game that was created during the 2018 Ukie Student Games Jam 
    at Staffordshire University by me and 4 of my friends. The game jam theme that year was <b>change</b>, our 
    team took this literally and we decided to make a mathmatical based game based on shooting the correct amount of change 
    (pounds and pence) to defeat enemies.
